00:00.100 --> 00:08.200
The old land of my fathers is dear to me,

2
00:08.200 --> 00:16.000
Land of bards and singers, famous men of renown;

3
00:16.000 --> 00:24.000
Her brave warriors, very splendid patriots,

4
00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
For freedom shed their blood.

5
00:31.100 --> 00:35.200
Nation, Nation!

6
00:35.200 --> 00:40.400
I am faithful to my Nation.

7
00:40.400 --> 00:48.000
While the sea is a wall to the pure, most loved land,

8
00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
O may the old language endure.

9
00:55.000 --> 00:58.300
Nation, Nation!

10
00:58.300 --> 01:04.100
I am faithful to my Nation.

11
01:04.300 --> 01:11.100
While the sea is a wall to the pure, most loved land,

12
01:11.300 --> 01:19.100
O may the old language endure!
