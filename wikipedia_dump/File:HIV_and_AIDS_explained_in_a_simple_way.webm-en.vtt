1
00:00.250 --> 00:03.265
We explain HIV and AIDS.

2
00:04.282 --> 00:08.582
The human immune system defends
the body against illnesses all the time.

3
00:08.966 --> 00:12.297
It uses guards in the blood called T-cells

4
00:12.330 --> 00:14.969
to recognize any intruders
and destroy them.

5
00:15.217 --> 00:17.235
But instead of attacking the body,

6
00:17.274 --> 00:23.159
the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV,
attacks those T-cells themselves.

7
00:23.287 --> 00:27.510
It turns them into copy machines
to make more copies of itself,

8
00:27.576 --> 00:30.615
then eventually kills
the infected T-cells.

9
00:31.236 --> 00:36.172
Without treatment, it takes 8 years
on average for a person with HIV

10
00:36.207 --> 00:40.333
to develop AIDS, or Acquired
Immunodeficiency Syndrome.

11
00:40.380 --> 00:42.529
By then, there aren't enough T-cells

12
00:42.562 --> 00:45.450
to fight off various infections
and diseases.

13
00:45.500 --> 00:47.988
So it’s not the virus directly,

14
00:48.038 --> 00:50.489
but the diseases,
that are eventually fatal.

15
00:50.550 --> 00:54.905
Humans first acquired HIV
from blood contact with apes

16
00:54.956 --> 00:59.466
and gradually transmitted it
to more people through unprotected sex,

17
00:59.480 --> 01:02.370
used syringes, and childbirth.

18
01:04.246 --> 01:08.230
AIDS remained undiscovered
until a sudden outbreak among gay men

19
01:08.264 --> 01:11.574
in New York and San Francisco in 1981.

20
01:11.869 --> 01:13.989
Very quickly, people began developing

21
01:14.022 --> 01:16.810
the same unusual symptoms
around the world.

22
01:18.875 --> 01:23.758
The patients suffered from rare forms
of skin cancer, pneumonia, or thrush,

23
01:23.791 --> 01:25.343
and few survived.

24
01:25.387 --> 01:29.440
Prejudice against homosexuality
made research funding hard to get,

25
01:29.490 --> 01:32.077
and more and more people
were getting sick.

26
01:32.940 --> 01:34.360
What could be done?

27
01:36.406 --> 01:38.533
Keep the virus from spreading.

28
01:38.868 --> 01:42.839
It became clear that the best
preventive measure was safe sex,

29
01:42.872 --> 01:45.911
as condoms kept the virus
from infecting others.

30
01:45.979 --> 01:48.986
Additionally, blood banks
started testing blood,

31
01:49.020 --> 01:53.345
and new programs even distributed
clean needles to drug users.

32
01:54.297 --> 01:59.097
Finally, in 1987, the first treatment
against the virus was released,

33
01:59.110 --> 02:02.053
the ancestor of combination therapy.

34
02:02.295 --> 02:04.543
The medication still isn't a cure,

35
02:05.117 --> 02:09.820
but it keeps the virus from multiplying
and destroying the host’s immune system.

36
02:11.750 --> 02:16.929
By starting treatment early, people
with HIV can now live long, healthy lives.

37
02:18.454 --> 02:22.478
Unfortunately, many people
still lack access to medication,

38
02:22.527 --> 02:24.846
especially in sub-Saharan Africa.

39
02:25.151 --> 02:29.190
Over the last 30 years
about 36 million people have died,

40
02:29.232 --> 02:32.046
while 2 million more
are infected each year.

41
02:32.375 --> 02:36.570
Scientists have made a lot of progress
but are still looking for the cure.

42
02:37.522 --> 02:40.359
You too can help end the AIDS crisis.

43
02:40.440 --> 02:41.679
Play safe.

44
02:41.728 --> 02:43.034
Get tested.

45
02:43.084 --> 02:46.085
Donate to support research,
prevention, and care.

46
02:46.545 --> 02:48.599
And spread the word.
