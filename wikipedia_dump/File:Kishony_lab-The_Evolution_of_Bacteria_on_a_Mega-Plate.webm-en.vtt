1
00:02.297 --> 00:05.119
So what we ended up building
was basically a petri dish

2
00:05.229 --> 00:07.205
except that it's 2 feet by 4 feet

3
00:07.205 --> 00:10.004
and the way we set it up
is that there are nine bands

4
00:10.120 --> 00:12.024
and at the base of each of these bands

5
00:12.563 --> 00:15.086
we put a normal petri dish thick agar

6
00:15.215 --> 00:17.067
with different amounts of antibiotic.

7
00:17.380 --> 00:20.133
On the outside there's no antibiotic.

8
00:20.545 --> 00:23.357
Just in from that, there is barely more

9
00:23.644 --> 00:25.084
than this E coli can survive.

10
00:25.579 --> 00:27.514
Inside of that there's 10 times as much,

11
00:27.854 --> 00:29.503
a 100 times and then finally

12
00:29.503 --> 00:32.223
the middle band has
a 1000 times as much antibiotic

13
00:32.313 --> 00:35.113
and then across the top of it
pour some thin agar

14
00:35.367 --> 00:37.551
that bacteria can move around in.

15
00:37.838 --> 00:40.245
The background is black,
because there's ink in it

16
00:40.656 --> 00:42.810
and the bacteria appear as white.

17
00:46.427 --> 00:50.193
First, you see they spread in the area
where there is no antibiotic

18
00:50.253 --> 00:52.440
up until the point
they can no longer survive.

19
00:53.055 --> 00:55.596
Then a mutant appears on the right.

20
00:56.728 --> 00:59.120
It's resistant to the antibiotic;
it spreads

21
01:00.060 --> 01:03.176
until it starts to compete
with other mutants around it.

22
01:04.769 --> 01:07.541
When these mutants hit the next boundary,

23
01:07.766 --> 01:11.250
they too have to pause
and develop new mutations

24
01:11.250 --> 01:13.498
to make it into
10 times as much antibiotic.

25
01:17.445 --> 01:20.804
And then you see the different
mutants repeat this at 100.

26
01:28.503 --> 01:30.849
And after about around 11 days

27
01:31.064 --> 01:34.357
they finally make it into
1000 times as much antibiotic

28
01:34.357 --> 01:36.551
as the wild type can survive.

29
01:36.837 --> 01:41.274
And so we can see by this process of
accumulating successive mutations

30
01:41.643 --> 01:45.629
that bacteria, which are normally
sensitive to an antibiotic

31
01:45.879 --> 01:49.378
can evolve resistance to
extremely high concentrations

32
01:49.437 --> 01:51.618
in a short period of time.
