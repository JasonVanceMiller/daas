1
00:07.250 --> 00:08.500
Ladies and Gentleman

2
00:08.500 --> 00:10.750
I'm Carl T. Rowan

3
00:10.750 --> 00:14.660
As the new director of
the United States Information Agency,

4
00:14.660 --> 00:23.160
I have the privilege to present to you 
a dramatic document of man's continuing
search for dignity.

5
00:23.170 --> 00:27.970
It is a film about the great
Civil Rights March in Washington,

6
00:27.970 --> 00:32.610
a moving exercise of one of 
the most cherished rights in a free society,

7
00:32.610 --> 00:38.570
the right of peaceful protest.
I believe that this demonstration of both

8
00:38.570 --> 00:45.370
Whites and Negros, supported by the federal
government and by both President Johnson and

9
00:45.370 --> 00:52.190
the late President Kennedy, is a profound
example of the procedures unfettered men use

10
00:52.190 --> 00:59.190
to broaden the horizons of freedom and deepen
the meaning of personal liberty.

11
01:01.160 --> 01:06.579
Freedom Now Movement, hear me: We are requesting
all citizens to move into Washington, to go

12
01:06.579 --> 01:11.350
by plane, by car, bus, any way that you can
get there.

13
01:11.350 --> 01:17.280
Walk if necessary.
We are pushing for jobs, housing, desegregated

14
01:17.280 --> 01:21.359
schools.
This is an urgent request, please join, go

15
01:21.359 --> 01:25.749
to Washington!
Negroes want the same things that White citizens

16
01:25.749 --> 01:29.810
possess!
All of their rights.

17
01:29.810 --> 01:36.499
They want no reservations, they want complete
equality: social, economic, and political.

18
01:36.499 --> 01:43.499
And no force under the sun can stem and block and stop this Civil Rights revolution, which is now underway.

19
01:47.029 --> 01:54.029
[singing] Hold On! Hold On! Keep your eyes on the prize hold on.

20
01:56.929 --> 02:01.849
On August 28th, 1963, two hundred thousand

21
02:01.849 --> 02:05.779
Americans came to Washington to demand complete freedom for everyone.

22
02:05.779 --> 02:12.779
This is the story of that day.
[singing] Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on, hold on. Hold on! Hold on!

23
02:21.430 --> 02:27.549
[singing] Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on, hold on.
Well if the FBI

24
02:27.549 --> 02:30.980
[singing] would investigate, then probably then

25
02:30.980 --> 02:34.519
[singing] we could get a break. Keep your eyes

26
02:34.519 --> 02:39.930
[singing] on the prize, hold on, hold on.

27
02:39.930 --> 02:46.930
[singing] Hold on! Hold on!

28
02:46.930 --> 02:52.930
Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on, hold on.

29
02:52.930 --> 02:59.930
Well we are all here black and white, trying to fight for equal rights.

30
02:59.409 --> 03:06.409
[singing] Keep your eyes on the prize,
hold on, hold on.

31
03:07.409 --> 03:18.409
Hold on! Hold on! Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on.

32
03:23.280 --> 03:27.859
They came from Los Angeles and San Fransisco,
or about the distance from Moscow to Bombay.

33
03:27.859 --> 03:34.030
They came from Cleveland, Chicago, or about
the distance from Buenos Aires to Rio de Janeiro.

34
03:34.030 --> 03:39.540
They came from Jackson,Mississippi, from Birmingham,
Alabama, or about the distance from Johannesburg

35
03:39.540 --> 03:45.060
to Dar Es Salaam.
By the end of August 1963, in some places

36
03:45.060 --> 03:49.859
of the United States, a Negro could not go
to school where he chose, eat where he wished,

37
03:49.859 --> 03:53.829
build his home where it pleased him, or find
jobs for which he was qualified.

38
03:53.829 --> 04:00.829
He had been insulted, beaten, jailed, drenched
with water, chased by dogs, but he was coming

39
04:02.090 --> 04:07.200
to Washington he said to swallow up hatred
in love, to overcome violence by peaceful

40
04:07.200 --> 04:12.219
protest.
Many people predicted violence; Negro groups

41
04:12.219 --> 04:18.090
trained themselves to overwhelm it.
Armed with portable two way radios, volunteers

42
04:18.090 --> 04:23.560
scattered throughout the March would keep
watch should violence come there that day,

43
04:23.560 --> 04:30.560
they would call for help.
Each man would have a code name: Freedom,

44
04:32.300 --> 04:39.300
Equality, Justice, Jobs.
The constitution of the United States guarantees

45
04:42.160 --> 04:47.700
every American the right to protest peaceably.
Two hundred thousand Americans, then, were

46
04:47.700 --> 04:53.660
going to use this right.
Three hundred and fifty years ago, white men

47
04:53.660 --> 04:58.880
came to America, and three hundred and fifty
years ago, the Negro came to America.

48
04:58.880 --> 05:05.470
The one came as master, the other as slave.
One hundred years ago, Abraham Lincoln declared,

49
05:05.470 --> 05:10.830
as President of the United States, that all
slaves would henceforward be set free.

50
05:10.830 --> 05:17.200
Now, both black and white Americans were preparing
to march, to say that a century later the

51
05:17.200 --> 05:24.200
black man still was not completely free.
If I am not free, you are not free; if one

52
05:24.420 --> 05:30.610
man on earth is partly enslaved, the world
is not completely free.

53
05:30.610 --> 05:37.430
It was every man's duty then to help every
other man.

54
05:37.430 --> 05:42.350
In New York, volunteers worked for two days
and two nights to make lunches for the march.

55
05:42.350 --> 05:55.350
They made eighty thousand cheese sandwiches.
[singing] We shall overcome! We shall overcome!

56
05:57.140 --> 06:05.140
[singing] We shall overcome someday!
Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe,
we shall overcome someday.

57
06:33.970 --> 06:39.910
The pins said, "I march for jobs and freedom."

58
06:39.910 --> 06:44.930
Everyone who marched wore one.
The two hundred thousand people who were to

59
06:44.930 --> 06:48.190
march that day were held together by the strength of that pin.

60
06:48.190 --> 06:55.190
This morning, Father, we ask that Thou would
hear the prayers of Thy children everywhere,

61
06:56.740 --> 07:03.740
those who are burdened down because of conditions
here in America, and those who are confused

62
07:06.510 --> 07:13.410
about how they should treat their fellow man.
Whoa, God rest for those that have hatred

63
07:13.410 --> 07:19.250
in their heart, to touch their hearts right
now, Father, and somehow fill their hearts

64
07:19.250 --> 07:23.710
with love.
You know God, make this a land in which live

65
07:23.710 --> 07:30.190
a land of plenty and a land of righteousness,
O God, may we recognize this land as a land

66
07:30.190 --> 07:40.190
of freedom for every race, o Father.
[singing] Here in my heart, I do believe,

67
07:41.630 --> 07:47.630
[singing] we shall overcome someday.

68
07:52.230 --> 08:02.230
[humming]

69
08:04.230 --> 08:32.230
[humming]

70
08:34.230 --> 08:37.230
Freedom! Freedom!

71
08:55.190 --> 09:07.190
5-4-3-2-1
Testing, 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1

72
09:09.140 --> 09:24.140
This is an audio test, 1-2-3-4-5
5-4-3-2-1

73
09:27.380 --> 09:35.380
1-2-3-4-5
In the night, few people had arrived.

74
09:36.400 --> 09:41.870
Negro leaders feared that their work had failed.
Those that did come, waited singing.

75
09:41.870 --> 09:59.870
[singing] O, deep in my heart, You know that
I do believe, O we shall overcome some day!

76
10:01.700 --> 10:06.010
We are encouraged, we are not going to fight
our white brethren with malice, nor are we

77
10:06.010 --> 10:11.500
going to fight them with any falsified stories,
nor are we gonna fight them with hatred, but

78
10:11.500 --> 10:14.770
we're gonna fight them with love.
When they hate us, we're gonna absorb their

79
10:14.770 --> 10:18.320
hatred in love.
When they speak against us, we're gonna speak

80
10:18.320 --> 10:22.410
things of love toward them.
We're not gonna let their hatred turn us around,

81
10:22.410 --> 10:29.410
but we're gonna love them on every side.
[singing] O, I do believe,

82
10:30.410 --> 10:36.410
[singing] O, we shall overcome someday!

83
10:31.180 --> 10:38.180
Shake hands with the person beside you!

84
10:41.990 --> 10:46.990
Are you gonna be free? Yes!

85
10:48.360 --> 10:50.360
Do you wanna be free? Yes!

86
10:51.500 --> 10:52.500
Let me hear you say it: Freedom!

87
10:53.160 --> 10:55.160
Let me hear you say it: Freedom!

88
10:56.250 --> 11:00.500
Let me hear you say it: Freedom!

89
11:30.250 --> 12:42.500
[chatter]

90
11:43.250 --> 11:48.500
[chatter and singing]

91
11:54.250 --> 11:56.500
Alright, just pass them back!

92
11:57.250 --> 12:01.500
Alright, I'll start on this side.
Alright, pass them down!

93
12:05.250 --> 12:14.250
If you have any questions, or anything that's
bothering you, be sure to contact your captains

94
12:14.630 --> 12:19.860
for anything, and they will take it from there.
Do not try to do anything on your own, because

95
12:19.860 --> 12:24.339
the minute you do, you will be upsetting the
purpose of this march.

96
12:24.339 --> 12:29.339
The whole thing is an orderly conducted march.

97
12:31.430 --> 12:44.430
[chatter]

98
12:48.580 --> 12:54.580
[chatter]

99
12:55.870 --> 12:58.930
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom!

100
12:59.930 --> 13:03.930
[singing] We are not afraid.

101
13:04.220 --> 13:17.220
[singing] We are not afraid. We are not afraid today!

102
13:18.880 --> 13:38.160
[singing] Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe,
We shall overcome someday!

103
13:39.160 --> 13:45.940
We shall overcome!
[singing] We shall overcome!

104
13:47.940 --> 14:01.350
[singing] We shall overcome! We shall overcome someday!

105
14:02.350 --> 14:22.000
[singing] Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe,
that We shall overcome someday!

106
14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
[applause]

107
14:30.000 --> 14:36.000
[singing] I'm on my way, and I won't turn back!

108
14:38.779 --> 14:44.779
[singing] And I'm on my way, and I won't turn back!

109
14:46.190 --> 14:55.190
[singing] Oh I'm on my way, and I won't turn back!

110
14:56.050 --> 15:03.050
[singing] I'm on my way, thank God, I'm on my way!

111
15:04.470 --> 15:08.470
[singing] And I'm on my way, and I won't turn back!

112
15:09.880 --> 15:17.880
[singing] And I'm on my way, and I won't turn back!

113
15:18.490 --> 15:24.490
[singing] I'm on my way, and I won't turn back,

114
15:25.350 --> 15:34.480
[singing] I'm on my way, thank God, I'm on my way!

115
15:35.480 --> 15:40.420
[applause]

116
15:48.420 --> 15:55.270
We call this section of our program to a halt,
and ask you to assemble in your respective groups,

117
15:56.270 --> 16:04.300
and begin the March for Freedom now.
Let us begin quietly and orderly to move out,

118
16:05.300 --> 16:12.450
remembering that by your great numbers, you
will force a slow, dignified, and stately march.

119
16:13.450 --> 16:15.910
We'll see you at the Lincoln Memorial.

120
16:21.910 --> 16:24.620
Very, very fine.
We're gonna wake up Lincoln, telling him to

121
16:24.620 --> 16:26.620
get up and stop tapping his feet.

122
16:28.620 --> 16:45.620
[singing quietly]

123
16:46.630 --> 17:18.630
[singing and clapping]
[chanting]

124
17:19.760 --> 17:41.760
[singing] Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom!
Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom!
Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom!

125
17:50.260 --> 18:04.260
[singing] Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom!
Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom!

126
18:06.070 --> 18:25.070
[singing] Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom!
Freedom, Freedom, Freedom, Freedom!

127
18:27.879 --> 18:31.879
[singing] Well if you walk the walk, then you talk the talk!
Well if you walk the walk, then you talk the talk!
[singing]

128
18:39.889 --> 18:46.239
[singing] Stayed on freedom!
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah!

129
18:47.239 --> 18:50.239
[singing] Well if you walk the walk, then you talk the talk!
Well if you walk the walk, then you talk the talk!

130
18:54.610 --> 19:07.610
[chatter and music]

131
19:08.820 --> 19:14.730
[singing] Stayed on Freedom!
Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelu, Hallelujah!

132
19:16.730 --> 19:18.799
Ladies and Gentlemen!

133
19:21.799 --> 19:28.799
Ladies and Gentlemen, your attention please!
Ladies and Gentlemen, your attention please!

134
19:33.009 --> 19:40.009
I would first like to congratulate all of
you on the orderly, dignified manner in which

135
19:41.179 --> 19:45.899
you executed the March from the Washington
Memorial.

136
19:45.899 --> 19:52.899
You have already told the world what we are
here for, and shown them by your courage,

137
19:53.119 --> 20:00.119
determinitation, and your order that we mean
business.

138
19:57.970 --> 20:01.970
[applause]

139
20:01.970 --> 20:07.970
We will now be favored with a solo by Miss Marian Anderson.

140
20:17.679 --> 20:21.649
We would like to do for you a Negro spiritual

141
20:21.649 --> 20:28.559
which has been a favorite of many audiences
through the United States.

142
20:28.559 --> 20:37.559
At the piano is Mr. Fax.
We would like to do for you "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands."

143
20:44.210 --> 20:49.210
[singing] He's got the whole world in His hands,

144
20:50.220 --> 20:57.220
[singing] He's got the big round world in His
hands, He's got the wide world in His hands,

145
20:58.190 --> 21:04.419
[singing] He's got the whole world in His hands.
He's got the wind and the rain

in His hands, He's got the wind and the rain

His hands.

31:59.849 --> 32:06.849
I think history was written today, which will
have its affect on coming generations, with

176
32:07.039 --> 32:14.039
respect to our democracy, with respect to
our ideals, with respect to the great struggle

177
32:15.669 --> 32:21.929
of man toward freedom and human dignity.
There were many who praised this day and said

178
32:21.929 --> 32:25.869
that there had been a new awakening in the
conscience of the nation.

179
32:25.869 --> 32:30.139
Others called it a national disgrace.
In the wake of this day, more violence was

180
32:30.139 --> 32:34.849
to come, more hatred.
But in the long history of man's cruelty to

181
32:34.849 --> 32:41.849
man, this was a day of hope.

182
32:42.059 --> 33:01.059
[singing] Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!
